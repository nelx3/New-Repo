# New-Repo
I'm using this repository to learn how github works

My name is Nelson. I've wasted a lot of time in my life doing irrelevant things, now i commit to becoming a full stack developer before the end of this year. So help me God, Amen.

If it's possible, i also want to build a lot of awesome projects on the way while i become the full stack developer.
